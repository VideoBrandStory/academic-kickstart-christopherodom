The film was released today and is available at Redbox, Best Buy, Wal-Mart, and Netflix. In the faith-based movie, which was shot in 2010 outside of Nashville, a convict named Luther escapes from prison and seeking revenge, takes John Smith and his family hostage in their home, as John was the detective who sent him to jail.},
