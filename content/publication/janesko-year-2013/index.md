abstract: "Beyond being dedicated teachers, Full Sail faculty members are also involved in outside professional projects. Some of these initiatives have brought our educators professional recognition. Hereâ€™s a roundup of a few of their professional achievements this year. Creative Writing MFA Course Director Christopher Odom also received recognition for his film. He wrote, directed, and produced a film called 23rd Psalm Redemption that was picked up by E1 Entertainment and released direct-to-DVD nationwide via Redbox, Best Buy, Wal-Mart, and Netflix."
