abstract: "In 1970, there was no internet, cell phone, VCR, DVD player, or cable television. All of these things factor into the equation of making it in Hollywood today. A philosophy for life on the road to success, rather than a blueprint to painting by numbers, HOW TO MAKE IT IN HOLLYWOOD BEFORE YOU MAKE IT is a portrait of 10 emerging artists on the front lines of Hollywood, running the gamut from actors, writers, producers, dancers, singers and songwriters, all at different stages in their careers. The companion piece to Christopher C. Odom's Award-Winning documentary, by the same name, the book offers more true life insight on what it takes to maintain in Hollywood on the path to success, as well extras like the documentary screenplay, production notes, interviews with Odom and the original festival press kit."
