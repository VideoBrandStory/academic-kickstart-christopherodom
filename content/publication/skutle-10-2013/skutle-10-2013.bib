 abstract = {Based on the two films of his that I’ve seen, writer-director Princeton Holt has something to say. Of course, a lot of filmmakers have something to say, but I’d be willing to bet that Holt is smarter, more focused than most. With his 2009 film, “Cookies & Cream,” and now, “The 10 Commandments of Chloe,” he has almost completely devoted himself to showing us stories of women along the edges of the entertainment industry, trying to navigate it as best they can.},
