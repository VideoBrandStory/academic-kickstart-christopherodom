abstract: "Set in Harlem's 1940's Savoy Ballroom, Alex Washington is a gifted Lindy Hop Swing Dancer, who dreams of being the next \"King of Swing\". In the vein of the Hollywood film classic \"All About Eve\", Alex challenges his Swing mentor. Juxtaposed against real life events and figures, Swingout is an unabashed fictionalized tale of desire and ambition, as Alex juggles the hot coals of the affairs of his heart, ego, family and friends."
