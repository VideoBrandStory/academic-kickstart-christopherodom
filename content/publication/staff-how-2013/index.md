abstract: "The plan was simple: We made our latest feature film, THE 10 COMMANDMENTS OF CHLOE, on a small budget. The stakes were set up to be low. We would experiment with form. We would experiment with storytelling. We would shoot it with no script, no rehearsals, and no shot list. We would completely self-release, but use traditional promotion avenues like reviews, blogs, interviews and film festivals to spread the word of our release. My partner in crime in this experiment was Naama Kates, an LA-based artist whom I had cast in my first feature. As producers, she doubled as my lead actress and I doubled as her director. We began discussing this project – this crazy 4 day shoot character piece concept with no safety net – and before we knew it, we were meeting in downtown Nashville, she flying in from LA, me from NY. With no other cast members or crew in mind, we had only ourselves and our DP (and co-producer), Christopher C. Odom, whom I had met only about a month prior."
