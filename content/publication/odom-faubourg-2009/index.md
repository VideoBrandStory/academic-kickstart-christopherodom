abstract: "Nestled at the edge of New Orleans' fabled French Quarter, Faubourg Tremé is one of America's oldest African American neighborhoods. This once vibrant neighborhood was the birthplace of the Civil Rights movement in the South and the home of jazz. Shot largely before Hurricane Katrina, FAUBOURG TREMÉ: The Untold Story of Black New Orleans pays tribute to what African American communities have contributed--even under the most hostile of conditions."
