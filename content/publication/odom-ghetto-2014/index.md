abstract: "\"It is written that the first born son of a Ghetto King shall inherit the Source. And he shall walk among us, robed as a servant, with a satchel at his side. And when the time is come, the fire of the word shall ignite and dispel the darkness.\" When Mellow Dee, a disgruntled postal worker, gets a message from an escaped convict, he must seek out the old Laserball player and Ghetto Knight, Elijah. In a world where the church has merged with the state, Mellow Dee is young and strong willed, but oblivious. Elijah reveals to Mellow Dee that King Ray-Ray, the imprisoned leader of the Ghetto Knights, is the father Mellow Dee never had. Elijah teaches Mellow Dee how \"to go to the Source\" and the ways of the Ghetto Knights. Together, Mellow Dee and Elijah have three days to steal a satellite crystal that will prove King Ray-Ray's innocence, take down the Dark Overlord, and prevent World War IV."
