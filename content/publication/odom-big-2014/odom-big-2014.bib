 abstract = {When an ordinary guy takes a Swing Dance class to impress an extraordinary girl, he becomes "Big Town" the flavor of the month and is forced to choose between the dancing or two girls. - "It ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it."Benjamin Bradley moves from the Midwest to Los Angeles to make good in the big town.  During his first week in L.A., Ben meets a vixen (Fate) and shy girl (Destiny).  Begin the triangle.  Fate is a fantastic dancer in the underground scene, but a lame person.  Destiny is a great person, but a mediocre dancer. Who should he choose?Written by a Swing Dancer who once graced President Bill Clinton with the Lindyhop, BIG TOWN is a Romantic Comedy with the heart of STRICTLY BALLROOM and the flash of SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER.  Rather than being a story with dancing taking the backseat, BIG TOWN is a screenplay written by a dancer, for dancers, where the dancing is the focus, and the story evolves organically from the dancing.},
