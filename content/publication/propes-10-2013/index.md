abstract: "The 10 Commandments of Chloe is about one woman's pursuit of the American Dream, a dream that seemingly comes at the expense of everything else in her life. Chloe, played with a serene and natural authenticity by Naama Kates, is a twentysomething struggling singer-songwriter who has plopped herself down inside the country music Mecca of Nashville determined to make a name for herself."
