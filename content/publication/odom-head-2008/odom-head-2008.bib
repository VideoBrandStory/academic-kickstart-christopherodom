 abstract = {Inspired by a true story, HEAD OF THE CREEK embodies the essence of a Shakespearian Tragedy.  When a brilliant bumpkin embarks upon lurid quest, his prize becomes his punishment. - "This above all: to thine own self be true..." (William Shakespeare, "Hamlet", Act I, Scene 3) Louis Wilson is a hayseed born with the aptitude of a Nobel Laureate.  At the age of 8, someway, somehow Little Louis has it all figured out.  He gets it.  For some of us it takes our entire lives to get it.  Others never get it.  Louis got it, and maybe you'll get it, too. His goal is simple - take an early retirement and live out by the old creek.  But Louis quickly learns what most of us already know -  the simplest things in life are often the most complex and impossible to accomplish. HEAD OF THE CREEK is a gritty, glimpse of Louis's simple goal that becomes a 30-year Machiavellian quest for Nirvana. - "He had everything it took to live right, but he chose to live wrong."},
