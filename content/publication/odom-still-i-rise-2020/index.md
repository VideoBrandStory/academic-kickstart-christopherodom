abstract: The “Still I Rise” remix is best experienced in the Chrome browser. Please turn on your speakers, as sound is essential to your Rise experience. Slowly and carefully mouseover each line and every word of the poem, whereas there are multiple hidden messages, both above and below the surface. There’s literally more to the Blackness than meets the eye. Continue to experience your Rise by clicking on the links.
