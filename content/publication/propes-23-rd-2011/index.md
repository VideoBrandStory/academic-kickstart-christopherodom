abstract: "Yet another example of faith-based cinema's increasing tendency towards edgier and more culturally relevant material, The 23rd Psalm has enjoyed an incredibly successful festival run primarily on the Black cinema and faith cinema circuit with notable wins at Berlin Black Cinema International (Best Film by a Black Filmmaker), San Diego Black Film Festival (Best Picture), San Diego Black Film Festival (Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor) and official selections around the globe."
