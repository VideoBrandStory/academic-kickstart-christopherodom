 abstract = {Directed by Princeton Holt from a screenplay he and his star Naama Kates wrote, The 10 Commandments of Chloe is an intimate look at regular people living the day-to-day. No one here is a superstar and no one truly aspires to be one—these are working artists who follow the music and not the money. Kates’ Chloe is introduced as a woman escaping into a brand new life of opportunity with no discernable past or interest in anything but the now. Hitting up bar after bar with a demo CD inquiring about booking protocol, she begins what could quite easily become a futile cycle of patronizing, disinterested faces. Her keyboard isn’t the most compact piece of equipment or this particular clientele’s normal Southern flavor either, so she has some work ahead.},
