abstract: "A well-meaning freshman becomes involved with campus politics to make a difference.  Now in too deep, the difference he makes is not intended. -- \"Does the end justify the means?\" THE HILL is a highly stylized transmogrification of the western storytelling paradigm.  Think MEMENTO or USUAL SUSPECTS.  It's a story about power - gaining it and losing it. Meet Adam. He's all that's American - Baseball, Crackerjacks, and Apple Pie.  Today is his first day as a freshman at Hillfield University. It's \"Freshmen Week\". Now introduce Evers. He's a Progressive, political, portly upperclassman who is far too nice to completely trust. Adam believes that Evers will introduce him to the world of campus politics; a world where Adam will learn to \"do good\" and serve society. But Evers knows differently. Soon Adam and Evers will ascend to the miry throngs of power, corruption, and greed - letting nothing stand in their way."
