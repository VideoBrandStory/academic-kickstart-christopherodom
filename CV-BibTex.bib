Learn how to invest in a Precious Metals or Gold IRA. Read this book now. It will help you save thousands of dollars in hidden fees and commissions. It's an absolute must-read before even considering investing in gold or other precious metals. Preserve your wealth. Protect your legacy. Read "How to Invest in Gold with a Precious Metals IRA" now.Why History Chose Gold: What it Means to InvestorsThe ongoing discussion about the fate of yellow metal in the coming years can be split into two basic arguments. Some people assert that the epoch of gold is finished, every time its price comes down. Conversely, proponents of gold caution that currencies will become insignificant and only those with the prudence to procure precious metals will benefit.You may be thinking that over the last decade gold has attracted excessively high number of investors or you might be thinking that colossal amounts of cash the government continues to print will certainly lead to collapse of dollar. Either way, you are omitting the point.Gold is Here to StayWhat we need to understand is that every commodity loses some value at sometime or the other and gold is no exception. It is not that history accidentally selected precious metals, particularly gold, initially as currency and subsequently for the purpose of hedging for financial purposes. This precious metal has inherent basic strengths, which do not increase of decrease with stock markets.To enlighten you why this precious metal will always find its position in market, we give below the most vital aspect of this metal that you would not come across in the current exciting debates concerning gold. This will make you realize why history was not mistaken about yellow metal.What Billionaires are SayingEike BatistaNET WORTH - \$30 BILLION"There is a massive shifting of wealth to new economic powers."George SorosNET WORTH - \$22 BILLION"The U.S. dollar is very weak. Investors are moving to real assets."Carl IcahnNET WORTH - \$12.5 BILLION"The system is not working properly."Securing Your Retirement Savings with a Gold IRAThe value of the U.S. Dollar is slowly depreciating and this can have a costly effect on your 401 K accounts without a gold IRA.The longer you keep your 401 K retirement fund in dollars the less you will actually have when you are ready to retire. How can you secure your retirement fund from this type of depreciations? If you already have a 401K from a previous place of employment than you may be able to rollover your money into another type of retirement account.Investing your 401K into an IRA or a self directed individual retirement account allows you to invest your money through a number of different holdings. These types of holdings such as real estate investments or precious metals are far more stable and profitable for you. If you are however, working a job that your 401K is currently active then you will not be able to rollover your current 401K to a new IRA account. You can contribute to and open an IRA account alongside your current 401K.A gold IRA (precious metals IRA) is one that converts your previous 401K into gold. These type of IRAs are one of the more effective ways to ensure your retirement savings is safe from devaluation and debasement. With a Gold IRA you will not have to worry about your financial freedom and can entrust that the fund you have been saving for years remain safe.Learn how to invest in a Precious Metals or Gold IRA.

Some of these initiatives have brought our educators professional recognition. Here’s a roundup of a few of their professional achievements this year. Creative Writing MFA Course Director Christopher Odom also received recognition for his film. He wrote, directed, and produced a film called 23rd Psalm Redemption that was picked up by E1 Entertainment and released direct-to-DVD nationwide via Redbox, Best Buy, Wal-Mart, and Netflix.},

	abstract = {The plan was simple: We made our latest feature film, THE 10 COMMANDMENTS OF CHLOE, on a small budget. The stakes were set up to be low. We would experiment with form. We would experiment with storytelling. We would shoot it with no script, no rehearsals, and no shot list. We would completely self-release, but use traditional promotion avenues like reviews, blogs, interviews and film festivals to spread the word of our release. My partner in crime in this experiment was Naama Kates, an LA-based artist whom I had cast in my first feature. As producers, she doubled as my lead actress and I doubled as her director. We began discussing this project – this crazy 4 day shoot character piece concept with no safety net – and before we knew it, we were meeting in downtown Nashville, she flying in from LA, me from NY. With no other cast members or crew in mind, we had only ourselves and our DP (and co-producer), Christopher C. Odom, whom I had met only about a month prior.},
